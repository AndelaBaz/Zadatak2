# Zadatak2
Project zadatak2 - example of creating a test class that connects to an Excel file and connects data

This is a modified copy of task 1. A test class was created that we connected with an excel spreadsheet to retrieve the data. 
Examples of usernames and passwords from Excel on the login page were tested. 
Two new page object classes were created, which compose the elements of the page with which we were supposed to interact.
